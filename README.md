# FuzzyLogic-ReactiveAgents
This was  a Tesina project that consist about create an AI for race games using  reactive agents with a fuzzy logic engine . The fuzzy logic engine help  the car at rotations  and curves for  avoid crashes analysing it's own speed and rotation wheels.The agents can follow a path and reach checkpoints ,also can  avoid obstacles with ray cast sensors, each agent can know its own position in the race and change it's max speed for simulate a more realistic competition between them.

## Technologies used:
* Unity 3D Engine 4.7
* C#
* LINQ 
* EASY ROADS
